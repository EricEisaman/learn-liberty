# Branch Protection Configuration

## Recommended Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection
```yaml
# Apply to: main branch
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  contexts:
    - "Unit Tests"
    - "Integration Tests" 
    - "Graphics Tests"
    - "Security Audit"
    - "Code Coverage"
    - "Test (Windows)"
    - "Test (macOS)"

enforce_admins: true
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: false
  require_last_push_approval: true

restrictions:
  users: []
  teams: []
  apps: []

allow_force_pushes: false
allow_deletions: false
```

### Develop Branch Protection
```yaml
# Apply to: develop branch
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  contexts:
    - "Unit Tests"
    - "Integration Tests"
    - "Graphics Tests"
    - "Security Audit"

enforce_admins: false
required_pull_request_reviews:
  required_approving_review_count: 1
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: false

restrictions:
  users: []
  teams: []
  apps: []

allow_force_pushes: false
allow_deletions: false
```

## Status Check Requirements

### Required for Main Branch
1. **Unit Tests** - Fast feedback on core functionality
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction validation
3. **Graphics Tests** - Graphics-specific performance and functionality
4. **Security Audit** - Vulnerability scanning
5. **Code Coverage** - Test coverage validation
6. **Cross-Platform Tests** - Windows and macOS compatibility

### Required for Develop Branch
1. **Unit Tests** - Core functionality validation
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
3. **Graphics Tests** - Graphics performance validation
4. **Security Audit** - Security vulnerability checks

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enable Branch Protection
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Unit Tests","Integration Tests","Graphics Tests","Security Audit","Code Coverage","Test (Windows)","Test (macOS)"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_last_push_approval":true}' \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":[],"apps":[]}' \
  --field allow_force_pushes=false \
  --field allow_deletions=false
```

### 2. Configure Status Checks
- Ensure all CI jobs have unique, descriptive names
- Set appropriate timeout values for each job
- Configure failure notifications

### 3. Review Requirements
- Require at least 1 approving review for main branch
- Require at least 1 approving review for develop branch
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Require last push approval for main branch

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- Prevents broken code from reaching main branch
- Ensures all tests pass before merging
- Maintains security through automated audits

### Collaboration
- Enforces code review process
- Prevents force pushes to protected branches
- Maintains linear history

### Reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility validation
- Performance regression prevention
- Security vulnerability detection

## Monitoring

### Status Check Monitoring
- Track status check pass rates
- Monitor average time to completion
- Identify frequently failing checks

### Performance Metrics
- Build time trends
- Test execution time
- Cache hit rates

### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability detection rates
- Security audit results
- Dependency update frequency
